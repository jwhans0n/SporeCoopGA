## Report
A list of limits and open ends of a feature, kept as one ticket.

Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* PvP damage is the raw damage of the shot: the shooter's damage-boost tool does not count (the base
  TakeDamage of the shooter's game is not called for the puppet, docs/re/space.md 11.2).
* Only hits of the own ship count: NPC ships and turrets of a player's game hit an enemy puppet only
  on the host (squadron relays NPC hits on puppets to their owner), not on a guest's game.
* A player who joins for the first time while rivals mode is on keeps the money of the host's save
  it loaded (it had no budget yet); a rejoining player gets its own budget back from the host.
* A guest that is not in space when the host switches the mode gets its share or merge when it is
  back in space; the merge counts its last reported budget.
* Spice gifts, tool gifts and the jump work between rivals as before (deliberate acts); mission
  rewards are shared between allies only; raid alerts reach everybody.

## Root cause
