## Report
"He doesn't even see my companion."

## Root cause
An NPC of a species only in the host's profile (own creations, downloads) failed to spawn on the guest ("unknown species").

## Fix
The guest asks the host for unknown species (MSG_CREATION kind 4/3), registers them and builds the NPC.

## Verification
coop_creature_desync.py: the companion stayed pending 3x before, built after.

## History

- 2026-10-25: fixed on fix/creature-desync, released in 0.7.2.3.
