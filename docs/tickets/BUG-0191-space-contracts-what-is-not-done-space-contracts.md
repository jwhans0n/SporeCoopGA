## Report
A list of limits and open ends of a feature, kept as one ticket.

Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* The armada attacks a colony of the host only: its waves are the game's raids, and a raid needs a
  planet of the raided empire in the host's save; the guests' colonies (feature 1's roster,
  `space_map.h`) are not in it. The host's NPC ships are the shared ones (squadron.cpp), so with three
  or four players the host has to be one of the two ships on the colony.
* The colony's turrets fight the raid too (on the homeworld they shot down 20 plain raid ships in
  ~25 s); the armada's ships have double HP, but a well-defended colony may still win a wave nearly
  alone. A raid the pirates win fails the contract; a raid still running at a timeout goes on as an
  ordinary raid.
* "Jump there" to the armada's star lands a guest next to a planet the travel picks (an own colony
  first): the host's colony is not the guest's, so the guest may have to fly to it in the system
  view before "Land" takes it to the right planet.
* SpawnUFO pirates do not fight (docs/re/space.md 10.2): an armada anywhere else than on an own colony
  (a neutral star, a partner's colony) would need the UFO AI's target selection, not found.
* While the game's badge panel ("Reward ... 2 badge points" + OK, after a defended raid) is up, the
  co-op window's buttons (all F9 pages) get no clicks; Enter or its OK closes the panel. The panel is
  modal (only it gets the mouse): bringing the co-op window to the front every refresh did not help
  (tried 2026-10-23, lane 3) and would have covered the panel's OK button, so it was reverted.
* A partner who leaves the session fails a running contract when the crew gets smaller than two
  (no grace time for a rejoin); a rejoining player sees the current contract within 5 s and can
  accept a running one again. Not covered by the test: a partner leaving, a rejoin.
* Joint terraforming contracts (a planet to a T-score together) are not done: the fixture has no
  terraforming tools to test them with.
* The reward tool is chosen from the host's cargo (the first one of the list it lacks); a guest who
  has it already gets only the money.
