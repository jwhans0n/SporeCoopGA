## Report
Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* Tribe: duet and healer bonus in real play (play_tribe.py plays real raids since 2026-10-23:
  pincer, the chief's aura and rescues happen there; the fixture's tribe has no instruments and
  no healer tool, so a social click on another tribe's hut is a food gift, CitizenAction 9, and
  nobody can heal: a fixture of a later tribe save is needed). Civilization: the religious role
  and trade in real play (play_civ.py plays military vehicles: the military role and joint sieges
  by real vehicles are covered). Space: raids and missions (no live mission in
  the fixture), spice trading with NPC stores (selling to a partner colony is covered by coop_space_trade.py), terraforming with the tools, buying in the city planner (the bot
  opens and closes it only).

## Root cause
See the report (observed vs inferred as marked there).

## Fix
