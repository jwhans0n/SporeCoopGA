## Report
Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* Backspace (Mating Call) at the nest with DNA shows "Mate: Locate your Mate!" and a thought bubble,
  but clicking the family members around did not open the editor within 30 s. Not a confirmed bug:
  how a player answers the call is not explored yet (docs/re/creature.md 5). The evolution vote is
  covered by `coop_vote.py` through `coop.vote editor`. The Cell stage's mating call is driven for
  real since 2026-10-24 (`coop_editor_desync.py`, docs/re/cell.md 12), and the Creature stage's first
  editor through the stage switch, not the creature mating call.

## Root cause
See the report (observed vs inferred as marked there).

## Fix
Not fixed yet.

## Verification

## History
- 2026-10-24: first recorded in docs/known-issues.md.
- 2026-10-27: ticket backfilled from docs/known-issues.md (every entry carries its ticket id, CLAUDE.md 1).
- 2026-10-28: fix/w4-tests (wave 4): not reached: how a player answers the Creature mating call (which object to click after Backspace) is unexplored reverse engineering. Left open.
