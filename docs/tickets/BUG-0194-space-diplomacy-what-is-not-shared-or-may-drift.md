## Report
A list of limits and open ends of a feature, kept as one ticket.

Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* **Names and species of NPC empires differ between the copies**: each copy picks them at the first
  contact (from that player's creations). The relation, contact and war/alliance state are shared
  by political id; notices name both ("Kirgle Empire (Alice: Judge Empire)"). Sharing names would
  need the species too (docs/re/space.md 12.3).
* Events the game raises on every copy by itself are not sent (personality / archetype at contact,
  the empire AI's be nice / be nasty, embassies, super power, avoided contact). Any other event
  between the player and an NPC empire is sent, also when the local AI caused it (for example an
  NPC destroying the player's buildings): if both copies' AI do the same, the host counts it twice.
  Guests converge on the host's table within 20 s; the host's own copy is the reference.
* An empire created after the join (uplift of a civilization, ...) gets a political id on each copy
  by itself (`NextPoliticalID`), the ids may differ: its events are dropped as "unknown empire"
  (`coop.space diplomacy` counter `unknown`). Not seen in tests.
* The comm screen is not driven by clicks in the test: `coop_space_diplomacy.py` calls the same
  game functions its buttons do (ApplyRelationship with the gift event, DeclareAlliance,
  DeclareWar, DeclarePeace); the money of a gift goes through the shared budget. Attacks on an
  empire's ships, missions and trade use the same hook but are not played in the test.
* Rivals mode (feature 10) turns sharing off; it is not tested here (the switch belongs to
  space_rivalry.cpp).
