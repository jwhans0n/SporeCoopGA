"""The host in an editor while the guest plays (BUG-0205).

After an evolution vote every player evolves in its own editor; the guest who leaves its editor
first plays on while the host still edits. The host sends no NPC states meanwhile, and until
BUG-0205 the guest counted the host "away" only in the main menu: the host's NPCs stood frozen on
the guest (proxies without AI and without states) for as long as the host edited. A guest's goal
card reward (MSG_SOCIAL K_GOAL) that reached the host in its editor (no creature) was dropped.

1. The host gives one species of the planet the "allied" relation (`coop.social record`), both
   evolve (`coop.vote editor`, the guest's real "I'm ready"), the guest leaves its editor at once.
2. The guest plays on (printed: what its game has and moves, see 5).
3. The guest reports a goal reward of 25 DNA for that species while the host is in its editor.
4. The host leaves its editor: its game DNA grew by the 25, the guest mirrors the host's NPCs again.
5. The host loads its world again (`coop.load`) while the guest watches its creatures (printed).
Steps 2 and 5 are printed, not checked: after its own editor the guest's planet held no creatures to
watch, and the reload was shorter than the away delay (BUG-0205 History). The check is step 4.

--nofix: `coop.corefix away_editor 0` and `away_goal 0` on both (the code before BUG-0205): must FAIL.
