"""A vote ends with its session and its stage (BUG-0043): its editor request or action is dropped,
not run later in another session or after the stage is gone (the civ superweapon used to fire on
the freed civilization of the planet the host had left).

  1. a real editor request through the vote, then the host's Leave and Host again: the host's game
     must stay in its stage (on the old code the stale vote ended "alone" and the editor opened);
     a new vote then starts and reaches the guest's window
  2. an action vote (coop.vote action, the superweapon's kind), then the host leaves the stage for
     the galaxy menu and the guest presses "I'm ready": the action must not run
