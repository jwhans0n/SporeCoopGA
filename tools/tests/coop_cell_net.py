"""Cell stage sync over a lossy, slow link (run with SPORE_NET, suite entry cell_net):

  BUG-0032  the host's state comes in unreliable chunks of 14 cells: a lost or late chunk made the
            guest delete those mirrors and create them again 0.1 s later (new pool cells: they
            blinked, lost their facing). The guest's pool index of every host cell stays the same.
  BUG-0051  the host eats, the guest eats over a level line before the host's total (without its
            meal) arrives: the guest's food total must not drop below what it had after its meal
            (before: back under the line, a level down and up again).

SPORE_CELL_FIX=0 switches the fixes off on both games (`coop.pool fix all 0`): the run that must FAIL.
