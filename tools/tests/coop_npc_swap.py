"""An NPC tick that does not return leaves no puppet as the game's avatar (BUG-0110).

On the host an NPC near a partner ticks its AI with the partner's puppet written into the game's
avatar slot (cGameNounManager +0x54) and puts the real avatar back afterwards. A fault inside that
tick, caught by the game's own handler, unwinds past the restore: the puppet stayed the game's
avatar for good and no NPC targeted a partner again.

The guest stands next to an NPC far from the host until NPC ticks run with its puppet as the
player (`ai_swaps` grows). Then `coop.npc swapfault` makes the next such tick leave like a fault
would (without its restore). The game's avatar slot must hold the host's own creature again a
moment later, and NPCs go on treating the partner as the player.
