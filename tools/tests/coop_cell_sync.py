"""Cell stage sync, bug wave 2 (on a plain link; coop_cell_net.py runs the lossy-link cases):

  BUG-0088  a mirror the game removed is recreated: the guest's local -> host index map keeps one
            entry per mirror (`coop.pool zap` removes mirror cells outside the mod's path).
  BUG-0128  the guest's food total differs from the host's (a total it missed while loading): it
            gets the host's within 3 s although the host's total does not change.
  BUG-0041  after a small respawn a meal over a level line: the guest's cell gets the game's size
            for the new level (the host's cell grows by the same ratio), not up to twice that.
  BUG-0070  the guest leaves right after a revive (still invulnerable) and during a knockout
            (translucent, 1 hp): its cell is vulnerable and opaque afterwards.
  BUG-0061  the guest left while knocked out and joins again with the same id: the host draws it
            opaque, not as knocked out.

SPORE_CELL_FIX=0 switches the fixes off on both games (`coop.pool fix all 0`): the old behaviour,
for the run that must FAIL.
