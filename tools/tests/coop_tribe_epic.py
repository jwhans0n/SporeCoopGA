"""Tribe: the co-op epic creature and the chiefs around a save and a leave (BUG-0146, BUG-0121, BUG-0067).

1. BUG-0146: the host spawns the epic; a member of an NPC tribe (owner 254) hits it, then only the
   host's members kill it. The reward is the one-player 30 food (the game's food, `coop.res`), not
   the "together" 80: an NPC tribe's member is no second player.
2. BUG-0121: two more epics are spawned and killed. The game's own object list holds no more epic
   herds than after the first one (one herd is reused, with target size 0) and no
   live epic but the planet's own ones (the fixture has one). A third epic is alive when the host saves through the game (`coop.save`): after the
   save the co-op epic is not in the world, so it did not go into the save.
3. BUG-0067: both players have a chief (1.3x its own size in the game). The guest leaves: on the
   guest no member of the player tribe is bigger than its own size any more (spatial GetScale /
   the citizen's desired scale). The host ends its session too: the same on the host, and the
   epic alive at that moment is gone.

--nofix: `coop.tribe fix epic_players 0`, `fix epic_herd 0`, `fix chiefs 0` (the old code): must FAIL.
