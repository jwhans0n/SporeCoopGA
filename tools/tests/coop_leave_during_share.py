"""A host that leaves the session right after the save for a world share was posted can still
leave its stage (BUG-0140): the share entry stayed in world's queue for good, save_busy() stayed
true and every quit message (0x4715068) was posted again, so the game never left the stage.

  1. the guest joins again: the host saves for the share; while "saved, being written" shows,
     the host presses Leave (coop.leave)
  2. the host leaves the stage for the galaxy menu (coop.menu posts the quit message): the game's
     own mode must reach GalaxyGameEntry
