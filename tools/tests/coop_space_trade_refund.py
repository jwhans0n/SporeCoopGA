"""BUG-0058: tool charges that come back while the sender is not in Space are owed, not lost.

The host gives 5 Antimatter Bomb charges to the guest, which does not answer yet (`trade hold 1`:
the answer is still on its way). The host is then "outside Space" (`trade away 1`: the feature
acts as outside Space, no inventory, which is what an editor or the menu gives it) when the guest
leaves the session, so the gift comes back while the host cannot take it. Back in Space
(`away 0`) the host's tool must have its 12 charges again (the game's cSpaceToolData ammo).
Before the fix the refund ran at once into no inventory: "no room, lost", 7 charges.

The outside-Space state is forced by a switch: entering an editor from Space with a gift on its
way and the partner leaving in that window cannot be timed reliably in a test.
