"""Cell: an NPC creature that both players go for faces the same way on the guest as on the host,
and both players' bites land, the lethal one too (the player report of 0.7.x: "enemies spun
uncontrollably for the guest, switching between facing the host and the guest, so they were almost
impossible to kill even with both attacking").

Both players swim at the nearest NPC creature for a while (the game's own steering towards the
creature, as a click does); the creature's facing (its rotation +0x5C, `coop.sync`) is sampled on
both machines. Before the fix the guest's copy (a soft body whose particles kept their own
orientation) turned 5x as much as the host's cell and was 150 degrees off in 1 of 10 samples.

Then each player bites a creature to death through the game's own Bite 0xE7B0A0 (`coop.pool
realbite`: what a bite event runs, DamageCell or, for a lethal bite, BreakOrSwallow). Before the
fix the guest's lethal bite broke the mirror on the guest only and never reached the host: a
creature of the players' size (6 hp, 3 per bite) could not be killed by the guest at all.
