"""DNA a guest earns while the host has no creature reaches the pack (BUG-0151).

A guest sends what it earns to the host (MSG_DNA_ADD); the host applied it only with a creature
of its own, so DNA earned while the host was in an editor, a loading screen or just leaving for
the main menu was dropped. While the host is "away" (main menu) the guest keeps it and sends it
when the host is back.

1. The host leaves for the main menu (`coop.menu`). As soon as the host has no creature (before
   the guest counts it as away), the guest earns 7 DNA through the game (`coop.dna add`:
   AddEvolutionPoints, the hooked game function): it goes to the host.
2. Once the guest knows the host is away it earns 11 more (kept on the guest).
3. The host loads its world again: the host's game DNA total is its saved total + 18.

--nofix: `coop.corefix away_dna 0` on both (the old behaviour): the 7 are lost, must FAIL.
