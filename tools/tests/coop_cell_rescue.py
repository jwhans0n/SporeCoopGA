"""Cell stage: a knocked-out partner rescues nobody (BUG-0131).

A lethal hit knocks a player out instead of killing it only when a partner is there to revive it.
A knocked-out cell is held at hp 1 and never flagged dead, so it counted as that partner: two
players knocked out side by side revived each other, and a lethal hit became a knockout although
nobody could help.

1. The guest is knocked out (a lethal bite from the host's side).
2. The host takes a lethal bite itself (`coop.pool selfhit`): its only partner is knocked out, so
   the game's own death runs (the avatar dying, +0x113), not a knockout (hp held at 1).
3. On the guest's machine the host is not shown knocked out (no `ko[0]=1`).

SPORE_CELL_FIX=0 switches the fix off on both games (`coop.pool fix rescue 0`): the run that must FAIL.
