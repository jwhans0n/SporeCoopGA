"""BUG-0128, the DNA half: the host sent its DNA total only when it changed, and a guest without
an avatar (loading, in an editor) dropped it. A guest whose total differs from the host's (a total
it missed: `coop.dna local <n>` changes the guest's own only) gets the host's within 4 s although the
host's total does not change. The food half is in coop_cell_sync.py.

SPORE_CELL_FIX=0: `coop.pool fix resend 0` on the host (the old behaviour, the run that must FAIL).
