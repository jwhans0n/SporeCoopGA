"""Civilization: the vehicles of a guest who left (BUG-0031).

1. The guest buys a vehicle in a player city (owner = the guest on the host).
2. The guest leaves the session (`coop.leave`); the host plays on.
3. On the host the vehicle has a present owner (the host), the host selects it in the game (the
   vehicle's selected flag stays set: before the fix the selection was dropped at once) and drives
   it: the game's position changes.
4. A capture next to it would name the owner of the nearest vehicle: no vehicle has an absent owner.

--nofix: `coop.civ fix orphans 0` (the old code): must FAIL.
