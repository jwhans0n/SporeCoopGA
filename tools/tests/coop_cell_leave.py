"""Leaving the Cell stage with mirrors on the guest, then the session ends (player report
2026-10-25, crash 2: the guest's game faulted in modes::cell_at <- cellsync::destroy_local <-
cellsync::on_session_end, in the Creature stage, 30 s after the host's game had crashed).

The guest mirrors the host's tide pool (cellsync); the host finishes the Cell stage the players'
way (food bar full, the cinematic, History, its check: the Creature stage) and the guest follows
with the host's world. The mirrors' pool indices meant nothing any more there, but the old code kept
them and destroyed them when the session ended (the host's BYE or a timeout): `cell_at` read a pool
the game had torn down (cCellGame stays allocated in the Creature stage, its pool does not).

  1. Cell: the guest mirrors the host's cells.
  2. The host enters the Creature stage, the guest follows.
  3. The guest forgot the mirrors (`coop.status`: `cell(guest): ... mirrors=0`).
  4. The host closes the session: the guest's game keeps running, no fault.
  5. The cell console commands outside the Cell stage answer "not in the cell stage" (no fault).

The report's guest got there through a timeout (the host's game had crashed); the host's BYE runs
the same disconnected callback (quitting one game would kill both games of the lane's bottle).
