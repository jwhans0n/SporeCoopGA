"""BUG-0125: a guest that leaves and joins again while the host's game stands in the pause menu
sees the animals around it once the host goes on.

The host keeps per guest id the NPCs that guest mirrors and forgot them only in its NPC tick, which
does not run while the host's simulation stands still. A guest that came back under the same id
during the pause was taken for one that already had them: no spawns, only states it drops.

Checked on the guest's game: creatures mirroring the host's NPCs exist near the guest
(`coop.npc list`, spawned proxies with their distance) within 15 s after the host closes the menu.
