"""Joining by host name while the name server is slow (BUG-0204), two instances (creature fixture).

The guest leaves, every name lookup of the guest is made to wait 4 s (`coop.slowdns 4000`, a name
server that answers late), and the guest joins `localhost:<port>`. The game's frames must go on
while the name is looked up (the lookup ran in the join command on the main thread: the frames
stopped for the whole lookup), and the guest must end up in the host's world again.
