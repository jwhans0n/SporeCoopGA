"""BUG-0119: after a reload the guest plays its own creature again, and only once the new world has
played for 3 s.

The mod told "a new world" from "the same world" by the avatar's address. The game pools creature
objects, so the avatar of a reloaded world can have the old address: the own-creature swap was then
taken as done (the guest kept the species the save gives it, the host's) or ran at once on a world
still loading. Whether the allocator gives the old address back cannot be forced, so the guest's
`coop.creations sameaddr` makes the next new avatar look like the old one (the state a reused
address leaves). The fix counts creature worlds (game::world_epoch).

Checked on the guest's game: the avatar's species key (coop.avatar) is the guest's own creation
after the host's world was loaded again, and the swap came at least 3 s after the new avatar.
