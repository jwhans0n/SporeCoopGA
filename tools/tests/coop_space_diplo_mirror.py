"""BUG-0071: shared diplomacy never sends the allies mirror empire (a partner's colonies, local to
each copy), so a guest is not allied with / contacted by an empire of its own galaxy that has the
same political id.

 1. The guest gets an empire of its own galaxy it never met: an allies mirror made and detached
    (`allies fake` + `allies detach`: the mod forgets it, the cEmpire stays with its star, no
    contact and no alliance), pol G.
 2. The host makes an allies mirror (`allies fake`, allied and contacted by construction) with the
    id G: each copy hands out ids from its own counter, so the host first takes the ids up to G
    (`allies nextpol bump`, as other new empires of its galaxy would).
 3. The guest asks for the host's table (`diplomacy sync`, the Resync button). The guest's record
    of G (the game's relationship entry and contact flags) must stay without alliance and contact.
Before the fix the host's mirror record was reconciled onto G: allied and contacted.
