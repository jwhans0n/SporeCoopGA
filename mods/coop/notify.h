// Co-op notifications: small native panels (the game's own UI system) that slide in on the right
// side of the screen, stack, and slide out after a few seconds. The kind (join, knocked out,
// revived, vote, chat ...), given by the caller or guessed from a system text, picks the panel colour and icon (data/ui/toast_<kind>.png, drawn by
// tools/make_icons.py). Works the same in every stage and in the menus; the full history stays in
// the co-op window (F9).
